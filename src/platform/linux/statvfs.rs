//! `statvfs` FFI binding + safe wrapper. Used by the fs plugin to compute
//! per-mount filesystem usage. Unsafe is contained here (in the platform
//! layer, which the unsafe-allowlist permits) so the plugin code stays
//! pure safe Rust.
//!
//! The C signature is `int statvfs(const char *path, struct statvfs *buf)`.
//! We must declare the COMPLETE libc `struct statvfs` — the callee writes
//! every field including the trailing `__f_spare` array, so an undersized
//! declaration is a stack buffer overflow, not just a missing field.
//! The layout below matches glibc on x86_64 / aarch64 (120 bytes); musl's
//! variant is smaller (112 bytes) and also fits inside this buffer, with
//! the fields we actually read at identical offsets.
