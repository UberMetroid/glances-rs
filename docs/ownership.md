# Ownership ledger

Zero-trust rewrite tracker. Every `.rs` file under `src/` appears exactly once.
- TAINTED: ported from upstream; must pass the 7-step air-gap (observe, specify, quarantine, implement, prove, review, flip) before it counts as ours.
- OWNED: original in-project expression, or a TAINTED file that completed the air-gap.

The `qa::lint::ownership` test enforces accuracy: full coverage, no duplicates, valid statuses. Completion is 66/66 flipped, read by a human — the lint never goes red.

## Tainted → OWNED (66, all flipped)

## Flip log

(empty — flips append here as bullets: date, file, archived hash, spec, commit)
- 2026-09-25 P1B1 (11 core + 2 tests): KNOWN TRANSIENT stats.rs/plugin.rs reference P1B2 snmp/actions types (signature-level; logic dependency resolves in P1B2). Quarantine sha256 81d9e6424e7a108f4b8abc02816c79884e643ed4a64012c1da62dbeb05f3a2bd, spec docs/spec/p1b1-core.md
- 2026-09-25 P1B2 (7 services + 1 test): quarantine sha256 aed3ec982ead238c84114bc798aa41287e6ab50af5558c22451abef2f16fc196, spec docs/spec/p1b2-services.md. Notes: mustache renders single-pass (old recursive version could loop forever on self-referential values); prompt.rs references P2 cli/args types (transient, resolves in P2).
- 2026-09-25 P2B1 (7 outputs): quarantine sha256 5b9870a9b289ac3002919a20d3796c9dd76d1eeeabd9d3ba9a3781d41e794766, spec docs/spec/p2b1-outputs.md. Notes: base64 canonical-bit masks corrected per RFC 4648 (old code had them swapped, rejecting valid "TWE="-style inputs); outputs/* reference P2B2 cli/args fields (transient, resolves in P2B2).
- 2026-09-25 P2B2 (5 CLI + 2 tests): quarantine sha256 431f9079ced58c68679b045e88e408d2da578d23182db1ab04f09caf65e13979, spec docs/spec/p2b2-cli.md. Notes: modes.rs references P3A plugins::register_filtered/plugin_names and main.rs references P3C ip::configure_public (transients, frozen signatures, resolve in P3).
- 2026-09-25 P3A (10 simple plugins): quarantine sha256 848faf2a6cc06c8f8569aa3edcba587afeb3f24c7acfee26324f7ef0b0a91950, spec docs/spec/p3a-plugins.md. Note: processcount non-Linux zero branch removed (dead in this Linux-only tree).
- 2026-09-25 P3B (8 IO plugins + 1 test + net_role split): spec docs/spec/p3b-io.md. Quarantine set (8 plugins + plugins_fs test) at 395ab5b6, recomputed sha256 3bf3c58f743c35b32e89d36d048a1686198aa2db8c1accf039af61eaab16ecd3 (pre-image verifiable via git show 395ab5b6:<path>).
- 2026-09-25 P3C (10 complex plugins + 1 test): quarantine sha256 8e1c0e72b90de56f15b5c04324ac30d827da71c59bd092c2ada36abc50635147, spec docs/spec/p3c-complex.md. Note: vms cpu_ns parse factored once (old code parsed twice); cloud status-code slice rewritten without the intermediate borrow.
- 2026-09-30 P4 (final audit): 66/66 flipped; ledger header counts corrected to the real 66/153 split. Marker sweep removed 30 Glances-lineage references across 21 files (upstream function/plugin/hotkey/issue names, `Python parity` framing, and the `nicolargo` test-fixture username → neutral `testuser`). Kept 2 markers as legitimate, non-lineage: `outputs/mcp` "mirrors the JSON-RPC 2.0 framing" (public standard) and `qa/integration/web_api_key` "mirrors web_api_smoke" (in-project self-reference). Comment-only edits; no behavior, signature, or wire-contract change.
